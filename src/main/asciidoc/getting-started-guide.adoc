[introduction]
= Introduction

Voting service is a RESTful web service for restaurants voting and creating restaurants with menus. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

[getting-started]
= Getting started



[getting-started-running-the-service]
== Running the service
Voting Service is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/mykola-pereyma/voting-service
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/voting-service-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/1/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.



[getting-started-creating-a-restaurant]
== Creating a restaurant
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new restaurant. As you saw above, the URI for working with restaurant is included as
a link when you perform a `GET` request against the root of the service:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a restaurant you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI, including a JSON
payload containing the name of the restaurant:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/1/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created restaurant:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/1/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created restaurant you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example
you can access the restaurants's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/2/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the restaurants's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/2/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `restaurant-menus` link which we'll make use of later.



[getting-started-creating-a-menu]
== Creating a menu
Menus should be always associated with specific restaurants and contains two to five userName.

Referring back to the response for the service's index, the URI for working with menus is
include as a link:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a menu you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI, including a JSON
payload containing the collection of userName and uri to related restaurant:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/3/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created menu:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/3/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created menu you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example
you can access the menu's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/4/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the menu's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/4/http-response.adoc[]

From get link "menu-restaurant" we can navigate to the related restaurant
and observe that menu has been added and visible as today menu:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/5/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/5/http-response.adoc[]

We can see all menus of the restaurant if we go and GET by link 'restaurant-menus':

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/6/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/6/http-response.adoc[]



[getting-started-voting-for-restaurant]
== Voting for restaurant
Users can vote for the specific restaurant by sending POST request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/7/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should produce a `202 Accepted` response:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/7/http-response.adoc[]

Lets create new restaurant:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/8/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/8/http-response.adoc[]

And then post vote the new restaurant:
include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/9/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/9/http-response.adoc[]

Finally user's vote should be posted for the new restaurant:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/10/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/10/http-response.adoc[]

In case if user try to vote not within allowed time frame he will receive '400 Bad request':

include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/11/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/creating-a-restaurant/11/http-response.adoc[]
